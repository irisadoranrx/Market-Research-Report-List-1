<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dementia Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>MAO Inhibitors</li><li>Cholinesterase Inhibitors</li><li>Glutamate Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dementia drugs market includes three primary types: MAO inhibitors, cholinesterase inhibitors, and glutamate inhibitors. MAO inhibitors work by blocking the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which helps increase levels of neurotransmitters and may alleviate symptoms. Cholinesterase inhibitors enhance communication between nerve cells by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine, improving cognitive function. Glutamate inhibitors regulate the activity of glutamate, a neurotransmitter linked to learning and memory, potentially slowing neuronal damage. Together, these drug classes aim to manage dementia symptoms and enhance patients' quality of life.</p></p>
